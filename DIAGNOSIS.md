# Todoist-Things Sync - Development Status & Continuation Guide

## Last Updated: 2025-08-08

## Current State
The bidirectional sync system between Todoist and Things 3 is fully functional with recent enhancements for reliability, testing, and monitoring.

## Recent Session Accomplishments

### ‚úÖ Completed Today
1. **Fixed Production Issues**
   - Resolved 403 errors from incorrect Todoist API token
   - Fixed JSON parsing in AppleScript for special characters
   - Cleaned up task count discrepancy (Todoist had 10, Things had 3 correct tasks)

2. **Reliability Improvements**
   - Added exponential backoff with jitter for rate limiting
   - Implemented idempotency with KV storage and TTL
   - Added error notifications to sync script (macOS native)
   - Created comprehensive health check script

3. **New Features**
   - `/sync/bulk` endpoint for force re-sync operations
   - Parallelized KV lookups for better performance
   - Things ID back-references in Todoist descriptions

4. **Testing & Quality**
   - Created unit test suite with vitest
   - 29 tests covering hash generation, fingerprinting, and sync locks
   - All tests passing

## Implementation Status

### Phase 1: Idempotency & Data Integrity ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Idempotency layer with KV storage
- ‚úÖ Schema versioning in TaskMapping
- ‚úÖ Bulk operations endpoint
- ‚ùå Force sync mechanism (partial - bulk endpoint exists)

### Phase 2: Observability & Monitoring üü°
- ‚úÖ Health check script
- ‚úÖ Error notifications
- ‚ùå Structured event logging
- ‚ùå Metrics dashboard endpoint

### Phase 3: Advanced Sync Features ‚ùå
- ‚ùå Conflict resolution strategies
- ‚ùå Selective sync by project/tag
- ‚ùå Batch operations for bulk import

### Phase 4: Testing & Documentation üü°
- ‚úÖ Unit tests for core utilities
- ‚úÖ Updated CLAUDE.md documentation
- ‚ùå Integration tests
- ‚ùå Setup automation script

## Continuation Prompt

To continue development on another machine, use this prompt:

```
I'm continuing work on the Todoist-Things bidirectional sync project. Here's the current state:

COMPLETED:
- Core sync working with fingerprint-based deduplication
- Idempotency layer implemented with KV storage
- Bulk sync endpoint at /sync/bulk
- Unit tests for utils (29 passing tests)
- Health check script at scripts/check-sync-health.sh
- Error notifications in sync script

PENDING TASKS (in priority order):
1. Add metrics endpoint (/metrics) to track sync performance
2. Implement structured event logging to KV
3. Add conflict resolution strategies
4. Create integration tests
5. Build setup automation script

RECENT FIXES:
- Fixed idempotency to actually store responses in KV with TTL
- Added bulk sync endpoint with auth protection
- Created comprehensive unit tests with vitest

The codebase is clean, tested, and production-ready. The main gap is observability (metrics/logging) and advanced sync features.

Please help me implement the next priority item: the metrics endpoint to track sync performance.
```

## Key Files Modified Today

1. **src/index.ts**
   - Added idempotency storage logic
   - Implemented `/sync/bulk` endpoint
   - Enhanced error handling

2. **src/utils.test.ts** (NEW)
   - Comprehensive test suite for utility functions
   - Tests for hash generation, fingerprinting, similarity
   - Sync lock management tests

3. **scripts/sync-bidirectional.sh**
   - Added error notifications via macOS native notifications
   - Success notification on completion

4. **scripts/check-sync-health.sh** (NEW)
   - Health monitoring script
   - Consistency verification
   - Task count comparison

5. **vitest.config.ts** (NEW)
   - Test configuration
   - Coverage reporting setup

## Environment Details
- Worker URL: https://todoist-things-sync.thalys.workers.dev
- KV Namespace ID: 63e1a66560e24129bfe0915501554381
- Repair Auth Token: Set in wrangler.toml
- Node modules: vitest, @vitest/ui installed

## Known Issues
- None currently - all systems operational

## Next Steps Priority
1. **Metrics Endpoint** - Track success/failure rates, sync times, task counts
2. **Event Logging** - Store structured logs in KV for debugging
3. **Conflict Resolution** - Handle edit conflicts between systems
4. **Integration Tests** - End-to-end testing of sync flow
5. **Setup Script** - Automate initial configuration

## Testing
Run tests with: `npm test`
Run with UI: `npm run test:ui`
Coverage: `npm run test:coverage`
