# Todoist-Things Sync - Development Status & Continuation Guide

## Last Updated: 2025-08-08

## Current State
The bidirectional sync system between Todoist and Things 3 is fully functional with recent enhancements for reliability, testing, and monitoring.

## Recent Session Accomplishments

### ✅ Completed Today
1. **Fixed Production Issues**
   - Resolved 403 errors from incorrect Todoist API token
   - Fixed JSON parsing in AppleScript for special characters
   - Cleaned up task count discrepancy (Todoist had 10, Things had 3 correct tasks)

2. **Reliability Improvements**
   - Added exponential backoff with jitter for rate limiting
   - Implemented idempotency with KV storage and TTL
   - Added error notifications to sync script (macOS native)
   - Created comprehensive health check script

3. **New Features**
   - `/sync/bulk` endpoint for force re-sync operations
   - Parallelized KV lookups for better performance
   - Things ID back-references in Todoist descriptions

4. **Testing & Quality**
   - Created unit test suite with vitest
   - 29 tests covering hash generation, fingerprinting, and sync locks
   - All tests passing

## Implementation Status

### Phase 1: Idempotency & Data Integrity ✅
- ✅ Idempotency layer with KV storage
- ✅ Schema versioning in TaskMapping
- ✅ Bulk operations endpoint
- ❌ Force sync mechanism (partial - bulk endpoint exists)

### Phase 2: Observability & Monitoring ✅
- ✅ Health check script
- ✅ Error notifications
- ✅ Structured event logging (via metrics)
- ✅ Metrics dashboard endpoint (/metrics)

### Phase 3: Advanced Sync Features ✅
- ✅ Conflict resolution strategies
- ✅ Configuration system for sync preferences
- ✅ Selective sync by project/tag with AppleScript support
- ✅ Batch operations (bulk sync endpoint)

### Phase 4: Testing & Documentation ✅
- ✅ Unit tests for core utilities and conflicts (55 tests)
- ✅ Integration test suite with mocks
- ✅ Automated setup script
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation (CLAUDE.md, SETUP.md)

```
I'm continuing work on the Todoist-Things bidirectional sync project. Here's the current state:

COMPLETED:
- Core sync working with fingerprint-based deduplication
- Idempotency layer implemented with KV storage
- Bulk sync endpoint at /sync/bulk
- Comprehensive metrics system with /metrics endpoint
- Unit tests for utils and metrics (41 passing tests)
- Health check script at scripts/check-sync-health.sh
- Error notifications in sync script

PENDING TASKS (in priority order):
1. Add conflict resolution strategies
2. Selective sync by project/tag
3. Create integration tests
4. Build setup automation script
5. Add webhook support for real-time sync

RECENT ADDITIONS:
- Implemented comprehensive metrics tracking system
- Added /metrics endpoint for performance monitoring
- Track success rates, sync times, task counts per operation
- Added metrics cleanup endpoint for maintenance
- Full test coverage for metrics functionality

The codebase is clean, tested, and production-ready with full observability. The next phase focuses on advanced sync features and conflict resolution.

Please help me implement the next priority item: conflict resolution strategies for handling edit conflicts between systems.

## API Endpoints

### Metrics Endpoints
- `GET /metrics?hours=24` - Get performance metrics summary
- `POST /metrics/cleanup` - Clean up old metrics (requires auth)

## Environment Details
- Worker URL: https://todoist-things-sync.thalys.workers.dev
- KV Namespace ID: 63e1a66560e24129bfe0915501554381
- Repair Auth Token: Set in wrangler.toml
- Node modules: vitest, @vitest/ui installed

## Known Issues
- None currently - all systems operational

## Next Steps Priority
1. **Metrics Endpoint** - Track success/failure rates, sync times, task counts
2. **Event Logging** - Store structured logs in KV for debugging
3. **Conflict Resolution** - Handle edit conflicts between systems
4. **Integration Tests** - End-to-end testing of sync flow
5. **Setup Script** - Automate initial configuration

## Testing
Run tests with: `npm test`
Run with UI: `npm run test:ui`
Coverage: `npm run test:coverage`
