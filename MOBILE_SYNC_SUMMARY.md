# Mobile Sync Endpoints Implementation

This document summarizes the mobile sync endpoints implementation for the Todoist-Things Cloudflare Worker.

## Files Created

### 1. `src/mobile-types.ts`
Mobile-specific type definitions:
- `MobileTask`: Core mobile task structure matching the Expo app model
- `DeviceRegistration`: Device registration data
- `MobileSyncRequest`: Sync request format with HMAC authentication
- `MobileSyncResponse`: Sync response format
- `MobileChangesResponse`: Changes polling response
- `MobileTaskMapping`: Mobile-specific task mappings

### 2. `src/mobile-auth.ts`
Authentication manager for mobile devices:
- Device registration with unique IDs and secrets
- HMAC signature creation and verification
- Timestamp-based replay protection (5-minute window)
- Device tracking with last-seen timestamps

### 3. `src/mobile-sync.ts`
Core mobile sync logic:
- Bidirectional sync with existing BatchSyncManager
- Mobile task processing (create, update, complete, delete)
- Integration with existing Todoist client
- Conflict detection and resolution using "newest wins" strategy
- Mobile ID to Things ID mapping with fingerprint system

### 4. `src/mobile-sync.test.ts`
Comprehensive test coverage:
- Device registration tests
- HMAC authentication tests
- Mobile sync request processing tests
- Error handling tests

## Endpoints Added

### 1. `POST /mobile/register`
Device registration endpoint:
- Accepts optional platform and appVersion parameters
- Returns deviceId and secret for future authentication
- No authentication required (for initial registration)

### 2. `POST /mobile/sync`
Batched sync endpoint:
- HMAC-authenticated requests with timestamps
- Processes created, updated, completed, and deleted tasks
- Returns mappings between mobile IDs and server IDs
- Conflict detection and resolution

### 3. `GET /mobile/changes`
Pull changes endpoint:
- Returns updated tasks since a given timestamp
- Includes tombstones for deleted tasks
- Requires deviceId parameter

### 4. `GET /health` (already existed)
Simple health check endpoint

## Integration Features

### Existing Architecture Compatibility
- **BatchSyncManager**: Reuses existing batch sync architecture for efficient KV writes
- **Fingerprint System**: Uses same fingerprint mapping logic as existing sync
- **Todoist Client**: Integrates with existing Todoist API client
- **Conflict Resolution**: Follows existing "newest_wins" strategy
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling patterns

### HMAC Security
- Device-specific secrets stored in KV
- Request signatures include payload + timestamp
- Replay protection with 5-minute timestamp window
- Device tracking with last-seen updates

### Mobile Data Model Mapping
- Mobile tasks map to Todoist format for server processing
- Preserves mobile task structure for client compatibility
- Handles list types (inbox, today, upcoming, someday)
- Label/tag synchronization

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Device Authentication**: Each mobile device gets a unique ID and secret for HMAC authentication
2. **Batch Sync Integration**: Reuses existing BatchSyncManager to maintain KV efficiency
3. **Fingerprint Mapping**: Uses the same fingerprint system as existing Todoist-Things sync
4. **Conflict Strategy**: Implements "newest_wins" strategy by default
5. **Mobile-Specific Storage**: Separate mobile task mappings stored with device context
6. **Timestamp-Based Sync**: Uses ISO timestamps for sync coordination and replay protection

## Testing

All endpoints are covered by unit tests:
- Device registration and retrieval
- HMAC signature generation and verification
- Mobile sync request processing
- Error conditions and edge cases
- Authentication failures

## Future Enhancements

The implementation provides a solid foundation for:
- Enhanced conflict resolution strategies
- Mobile-specific sync optimizations
- Background sync coordination
- Metrics and monitoring integration
- Offline-first mobile app support

## Compatibility

The mobile endpoints are fully compatible with the existing Worker functionality:
- All existing endpoints continue to work unchanged
- Shared KV namespace with proper key prefixing
- Consistent error handling and response formats
- No breaking changes to existing integrations
